WYSIWYG stands for What You See Is What You Get. It works similar to a word processor, where you can select the style for the content and see how it is going to look on the page.</p>
<p>Among available WYSIWYG editors CMS Made Simple has decided to use MicroTiny (the stripped down version of TinyMCE). TinyMCE is among the most developed WYSIWYG editors, with regular updates, a large following and customizable features.</p>
<p>However, it is very difficult to create a cross-browser online editor that works in all different kinds of environments. If you are familiar with HTML you can select no WYSIWYG in My Preferences &raquo; User Preferences in the Admin Panel. That gives you more control over the code that will be on the page.</p>
<p>There are also other WYSIWYG editor modules available for download.</p><?php }} ?>
